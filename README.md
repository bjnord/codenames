# Big-Screen Display for Codenames

This is a “big-screen display” companion app for the [Codenames](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codenames_(board_game)) board game by Czech Games.

We find (especially with a large group) that Codenames is more fun to play in the living room, where people can sit wherever they’d like instead of seated around a table. What’s needed is a big display of the board that everyone can see. The television is ideal for this!

1. The spymaster uses this app on their small device to enter the words and red/blue for each square. They can then keep the app hidden and use it when giving clues, and use it as a “remote control” to reveal squares on the big-screen device when their team makes their guesses.

1. The app also runs on the big-screen device, showing all words and just the revealed colors as the game progresses. It updates automatically in response to actions performed on the small device.

This app is a mobile web app; nothing needs to be installed on your phone/handheld device, just visit the web page.

## Credits

Thanks to my nephew Mark for the idea of using the TV, and to my son Doug for demonstrating this concept using a shared/live Google Sheets spreadsheet, inspiring me to write this app.
